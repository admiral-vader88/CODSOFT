Task 1 at Codsoft:
Movie Genre classification Model using Machine Learning 
n this machine learning project, we aim to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. We will leverage techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and using multinomial Naive Bayes to build an accurate genre classification model.
